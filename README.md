[THIS CONFIG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kingvornex/Iran-Clash-Serverless/refs/heads/main/config6.yml) is a **highly advanced, performance- and evasion-oriented network/proxy configuration** for **Clash/Clash.Meta** (or compatible clients). Its purpose is to optimize traffic routing, enhance privacy, bypass throttling, and fragment traffic to avoid detection, particularly for heavy services like YouTube and Google Video. Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### **1. General Purpose**

* **Mixed-port:** Accepts both HTTP/SOCKS proxies on port 7890.
* **Allow-LAN:** Lets other devices in your LAN use this proxy.
* **Mode:** `rule` â†’ traffic is routed according to defined rules.
* **Logging & Controller:** Info-level logs and local web controller for monitoring.
* **Profile options:** Stores selected nodes and fake-IP mappings.

---

### **2. DNS Setup**

* **Enhanced fake-IP DNS**:

  * Resolves blocked/targeted domains to fake IPs to bypass network filters.
  * `fake-ip-range` is set (`198.18.0.1/16`) for internal mapping.
  * Filters (`fake-ip-filter`) apply fake-IP only to ads and `.ir` domains.
* **Nameservers:** Cloudflare DNS (IPv4 + IPv6) with DoH support.
* **Fallback & hosts:** Ensures important services (Cloudflare DNS) are always reachable.

**Purpose:**

* Block ads, improve privacy, avoid DNS-based throttling, and maintain connectivity with key services.

---

### **3. Proxies**

#### **Fragmentation Proxies**

* `frag-hello-1`, `frag-small-1`, `frag-mid-1`, etc.
* Uses **TCP fragmentation**: splits packets into smaller fragments.
* `tcp-fragment` options control the number of packets, lengths, intervals.
* **Purpose:** Avoid DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) by splitting large packets, making detection or throttling harder.

#### **Fragmentation Chains**

* `frag-chain-skip â†’ frag-chain-next â†’ frag-chain-final`
* Configured for **chained fragmentation**.
* **Purpose:** Add complexity to traffic patterns; harder for ISPs or firewalls to detect patterns.

#### **UDP Noise Proxies**

* `udp-noises-v4` & `udp-noises-v6`
* Sends random UDP packets at intervals (`udp-noise`) to obscure traffic.
* **Purpose:** Evade detection of QUIC/UDP traffic and simulate normal UDP noise.

#### **Direct & Block Proxies**

* `direct-out`: pass traffic without modification.
* `block-out`: reject traffic to block unwanted destinations.

#### **Remote Proxies**

* Placeholder examples (`remote-vmess-1`, `remote-vmess-2`) for connecting to external secure tunnels.
* Supports TLS, WebSocket, and VMess protocol.

---

### **4. Proxy Groups**

* **Load-balance groups:**
  Distribute traffic across multiple proxies for reliability or evasion:

  * `FRAG_LB_ROUND`: Round-robin for fragmented traffic.
  * `FRAG_CHAIN_LB`: Consistent-hashing for fragment chains.
  * `UDP_NOISES_GROUP`: For QUIC/UDP traffic obfuscation.
  * `REMOTE_FALLBACKS`: Stick-session load-balancing among remote nodes.

* **Selection groups:**

  * `SUPER_CHAIN_SELECT`: Chooses between fragment chains, load-balance, or direct-out.
  * `YT_HEAVY`: Specifically routes YouTube/Google video traffic through complex fragmentation + chains.
  * `DEFAULT_GROUP`: Catch-all, prioritizing fragment/load-balance, UDP noise, or direct/block.

**Purpose:**

* Maximizes throughput and evasion for heavy services (video streaming, social media, CDNs) while maintaining fallback options.

---

### **5. Rules**

* **DNS:** Direct resolution locally.
* **Ads & private IPs:** Blocked.
* **Heavy services (YouTube, Google Video, socials, CDNs):** Routed via fragmentation chains or load-balance groups.
* **UDP/QUIC ports (443, 2053, 8443):** Routed via UDP noise proxies.
* **Cloud providers:** Certain IPs routed through fragment chains.
* **Fallback:** Default traffic routed via `DEFAULT_GROUP`.

**Purpose:**

* Aggressively route traffic to prevent throttling, improve streaming experience, obscure traffic patterns, and block unwanted domains.

---

### **6. Overall Purpose**

1. **Evade ISP throttling / DPI:** Fragmentation, UDP noise, and chain proxies make detection difficult.
2. **Improve performance and redundancy:** Load-balancing proxies for heavy services.
3. **Bypass geo-restrictions or firewall rules:** Via remote VMess/Trojan/SS proxies.
4. **Block ads & unwanted traffic:** Local fake-IP DNS and block-out rules.
5. **Optimize video/social media streaming:** Specific heavy-service rules like `YT_HEAVY`.

---

ðŸ’¡ **TL;DR:**
This config is essentially a **"super-heavy Mihomo" anti-throttling, anti-DPI, multi-chain/proxy load-balancing setup** for Clash/Clash.Meta, optimized for YouTube, Google, social media, and general obfuscation of network traffic, while also providing ad-blocking and fake-IP DNS for privacy.

Special flows:
 - DNS (port 53) => direct-out (local resolver)
 - Ads / private IPs => block-out or direct-out (depending on rule)
 - Cloudflare/Cloudfront GEOIP => FRAG_CHAIN_LB (apply fragmentation chain)
 - MATCH => DEFAULT_GROUP (tries SUPER_CHAIN_SELECT -> UDP_NOISES -> direct -> block)
