[THIS CONFIG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kingvornex/Iran-Clash-Serverless/refs/heads/main/config6.yml) is a **highly advanced, performance- and evasion-oriented network/proxy configuration** for **Clash/Clash.Meta** (or compatible clients). Its purpose is to optimize traffic routing, enhance privacy, bypass throttling, and fragment traffic to avoid detection, particularly for heavy services like YouTube and Google Video. Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### **1. General Purpose**

* **Mixed-port:** Accepts both HTTP/SOCKS proxies on port 7890.
* **Allow-LAN:** Lets other devices in your LAN use this proxy.
* **Mode:** `rule` â†’ traffic is routed according to defined rules.
* **Logging & Controller:** Info-level logs and local web controller for monitoring.
* **Profile options:** Stores selected nodes and fake-IP mappings.

---

### **2. DNS Setup**

* **Enhanced fake-IP DNS**:

  * Resolves blocked/targeted domains to fake IPs to bypass network filters.
  * `fake-ip-range` is set (`198.18.0.1/16`) for internal mapping.
  * Filters (`fake-ip-filter`) apply fake-IP only to ads and `.ir` domains.
* **Nameservers:** Cloudflare DNS (IPv4 + IPv6) with DoH support.
* **Fallback & hosts:** Ensures important services (Cloudflare DNS) are always reachable.

**Purpose:**

* Block ads, improve privacy, avoid DNS-based throttling, and maintain connectivity with key services.

---

### **3. Proxies**

#### **Fragmentation Proxies**

* `frag-hello-1`, `frag-small-1`, `frag-mid-1`, etc.
* Uses **TCP fragmentation**: splits packets into smaller fragments.
* `tcp-fragment` options control the number of packets, lengths, intervals.
* **Purpose:** Avoid DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) by splitting large packets, making detection or throttling harder.

#### **Fragmentation Chains**

* `frag-chain-skip â†’ frag-chain-next â†’ frag-chain-final`
* Configured for **chained fragmentation**.
* **Purpose:** Add complexity to traffic patterns; harder for ISPs or firewalls to detect patterns.

#### **UDP Noise Proxies**

* `udp-noises-v4` & `udp-noises-v6`
* Sends random UDP packets at intervals (`udp-noise`) to obscure traffic.
* **Purpose:** Evade detection of QUIC/UDP traffic and simulate normal UDP noise.

#### **Direct & Block Proxies**

* `direct-out`: pass traffic without modification.
* `block-out`: reject traffic to block unwanted destinations.

#### **Remote Proxies**

* Placeholder examples (`remote-vmess-1`, `remote-vmess-2`) for connecting to external secure tunnels.
* Supports TLS, WebSocket, and VMess protocol.

---

### **4. Proxy Groups**

* **Load-balance groups:**
  Distribute traffic across multiple proxies for reliability or evasion:

  * `FRAG_LB_ROUND`: Round-robin for fragmented traffic.
  * `FRAG_CHAIN_LB`: Consistent-hashing for fragment chains.
  * `UDP_NOISES_GROUP`: For QUIC/UDP traffic obfuscation.
  * `REMOTE_FALLBACKS`: Stick-session load-balancing among remote nodes.

* **Selection groups:**

  * `SUPER_CHAIN_SELECT`: Chooses between fragment chains, load-balance, or direct-out.
  * `YT_HEAVY`: Specifically routes YouTube/Google video traffic through complex fragmentation + chains.
  * `DEFAULT_GROUP`: Catch-all, prioritizing fragment/load-balance, UDP noise, or direct/block.

**Purpose:**

* Maximizes throughput and evasion for heavy services (video streaming, social media, CDNs) while maintaining fallback options.

---

### **5. Rules**

* **DNS:** Direct resolution locally.
* **Ads & private IPs:** Blocked.
* **Heavy services (YouTube, Google Video, socials, CDNs):** Routed via fragmentation chains or load-balance groups.
* **UDP/QUIC ports (443, 2053, 8443):** Routed via UDP noise proxies.
* **Cloud providers:** Certain IPs routed through fragment chains.
* **Fallback:** Default traffic routed via `DEFAULT_GROUP`.

**Purpose:**

* Aggressively route traffic to prevent throttling, improve streaming experience, obscure traffic patterns, and block unwanted domains.

---

### **6. Overall Purpose**

1. **Evade ISP throttling / DPI:** Fragmentation, UDP noise, and chain proxies make detection difficult.
2. **Improve performance and redundancy:** Load-balancing proxies for heavy services.
3. **Bypass geo-restrictions or firewall rules:** Via remote VMess/Trojan/SS proxies.
4. **Block ads & unwanted traffic:** Local fake-IP DNS and block-out rules.
5. **Optimize video/social media streaming:** Specific heavy-service rules like `YT_HEAVY`.

---

ðŸ’¡ **TL;DR:**
This config is essentially a **"super-heavy Mihomo" anti-throttling, anti-DPI, multi-chain/proxy load-balancing setup** for Clash/Clash.Meta, optimized for YouTube, Google, social media, and general obfuscation of network traffic, while also providing ad-blocking and fake-IP DNS for privacy.

```
Special flows:
 - DNS (port 53) => direct-out (local resolver)
 - Ads / private IPs => block-out or direct-out (depending on rule)
 - Cloudflare/Cloudfront GEOIP => FRAG_CHAIN_LB (apply fragmentation chain)
 - MATCH => DEFAULT_GROUP (tries SUPER_CHAIN_SELECT -> UDP_NOISES -> direct -> block)

# clash meta rule types:
Clash.Meta offers an advanced rule-based system that allows users to define granular network traffic routing policies. In addition to the primary rule types, Clash.Meta supports various subtypes and conditions, enhancing flexibility and control.

---

## ðŸ”§ Rule Types and Subtypes in Clash.Meta

Below is a comprehensive list of supported rule types, including their subtypes and conditions:

### 1. **DOMAIN Matching Rules**

These rules match based on domain names or patterns.

* `DOMAIN`: Matches exact domain names.
* `DOMAIN-SUFFIX`: Matches domains with a specific suffix.
* `DOMAIN-KEYWORD`: Matches domains containing a specific keyword.
* `DOMAIN-WILDCARD`: Wildcard matching, supports `*` and `?` wildcards.
* `DOMAIN-REGEX`: Matches domains using regular expressions.

### 2. **GEOIP Rules**

These rules route traffic based on the geographic location of the destination IP address.

* `GEOIP`: Matches based on the country code of the destination IP.
* `GEOIP6`: Matches based on the country code of the destination IPv6 address.
* `GEOSITE`: Matches domains within a specific geosite category.

### 3. **IP-CIDR Rules**

These rules match based on IP address ranges.

* `IP-CIDR`: Matches destination IPv4 address ranges.
* `IP-CIDR6`: Matches destination IPv6 address ranges.
* `SRC-IP-CIDR`: Matches source IPv4 address ranges.
* `SRC-IP-CIDR6`: Matches source IPv6 address ranges.

### 4. **Port Matching Rules**

These rules match based on port numbers.

* `DST-PORT`: Matches destination port numbers.
* `SRC-PORT`: Matches source port numbers.

*Note: These rules support multiport conditions, allowing specification of multiple ports or port ranges (e.g., `123/136/137-139`).*

### 5. **Process Matching Rules**

These rules match based on the process name or path.

* `PROCESS-NAME`: Matches the name of the process sending the packet.
* `PROCESS-PATH`: Matches the path of the process sending the packet.

### 6. **Rule Set and Script Rules**

These rules allow for dynamic rule evaluation.

* `RULE-SET`: Matches based on an external rule provider.
* `SCRIPT`: Matches based on the evaluation of a script.

### 7. **Network and Subrule Conditions**

These conditions apply additional filters to rules.

* `network`: Specifies the network type (e.g., `tcp`, `udp`) for the rule.
* `subRules`: Defines additional subrules to refine the matching criteria.

*Example: `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,bilibili.com,DIRECT,tcp` routes TCP traffic to `bilibili.com` directly, while `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,bilibili.com,REJECT,udp` rejects UDP traffic to the same domain.*

### 8. **Match Rule**

A catch-all rule that matches any traffic not matched by previous rules.

* `MATCH`: A catch-all rule that matches any traffic not matched by previous rules.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example Configuration

```yaml
rules:
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,bilibili.com,DIRECT,tcp
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,bilibili.com,REJECT,udp
  - DST-PORT,123/136/137-139,DIRECT,udp
  - GEOSITE,category-ads-all,REJECT
  - GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
  - MATCH,PROXY
```

In this configuration:

* TCP traffic to `bilibili.com` is routed directly.
* UDP traffic to `bilibili.com` is rejected.
* UDP traffic to ports 123, 136, 137, and 139 is routed directly.
* Traffic matching the `category-ads-all` geosite is rejected.
* Traffic to IPs in China is routed directly.
* All other traffic is routed through the `PROXY` policy.

---
