# 🎬 Serverless YouTube Config for Clash Meta / Mihomo

A serverless YouTube–unblock configuration for **Clash Meta** / **Mihomo** clients, powered by **Xray-core**, letting users access YouTube without maintaining a proxy server.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Zero infrastructure** — no need to host your own proxy server  
- Works with **Clash Meta** / **Mihomo** (YAML / config format)  
- Optimized rules & routing for YouTube traffic  
- Low latency, minimal overhead  
- Easy to import into your client  
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements & Compatibility

- Xray-core (version compatible with serverless feature)  
- Clash Meta or Mihomo client that supports custom config import  
- (Optional) DNS / geo files if used in your config  
- A network environment where this config can bypass restrictions  

> **Note:** Some clients (e.g. v2rayNG) have known issues with serverless JSON/YAML files. See related issues. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 📦 Usage

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open the config file (e.g. `serverless-youtube.yaml` or `.json`)  
3. Import it into your Clash Meta / Mihomo client  
4. Enable and apply the config  
5. Test YouTube — traffic should automatically route via the serverless logic  

You can also merge or override rules as needed to customize for your ISP or local restrictions.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Notes

- If YouTube doesn’t work, check whether your client supports all features in the config  
- Watch for version compatibility between Xray-core and the config  
- Some ISPs may detect and block specific patterns — adapt SNI, TLS or fallback rules  
- Submit issues if you find bugs or improvements
